Hi! **Thanks a lot** for your interest in our work. 

This repository contains the code for the paper `Do deep neural networks learn shallow learnable examples first?`. 
The paper will be presented as a ORAL at the [Deep Learning Phenomenon Workshop](http://deep-phenomena.org/) at [ICML 2019](https://icml.cc/).


The code will be up by *August 26*. Stay Tuned! 
Full paper is available at this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=150VZUEFmv2hwMLk7ZT4szdyznp6h7FNf) .
